        My positive points are the speed, very comfortable for traveling on the road.
        Its good fuel economy allows about 400km with a 12 liter tank.
        My negative points are the quality of the seat, very hard for a long trip.
        Their factory covers are of poor quality.
        In short, it is a good motorcycle according to its quality-price ratio, perfect for those starting out in the world of motorcycles.
